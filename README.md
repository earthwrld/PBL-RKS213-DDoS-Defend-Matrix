# PBL-RKS213-DDoS-Defend-Matrix
Pbl Semester 2 ddos defend matrix

## Overview

The DDoS Defend Matrix project is designed to develop a robust defense system against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using cutting-edge technologies. The system combines various mitigation techniques such as filtering, rate limiting, and traffic analysis to effectively detect and counteract DDoS attacks. This project aims to enhance network security, ensure service availability, and minimize the impact of DDoS attacks on IT infrastructure.

## Features

- **Advanced Detection:** Utilizes traffic analysis to identify potential DDoS attacks.
- **Mitigation Techniques:** Implements filtering and rate limiting to control and manage traffic during an attack.
- **Simulation:** Includes DDoS attack simulations to test and refine the system's effectiveness.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time insights and alerts on network security status.
